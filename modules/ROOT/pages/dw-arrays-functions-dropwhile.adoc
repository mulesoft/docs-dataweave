[[dropwhile1]]
== dropWhile<T&#62;&#40;array: Array<T&#62;, condition: &#40;item: T&#41; &#45;&#62; Boolean&#41;: Array<T&#62;

Drops elements from the array while the condition is met but stops the selection process
when it reaches an element that fails to satisfy the condition.

=== Parameters

[%header, cols="1,3"]

| Name | Description
| `array` | The array of elements.
| `condition` | The condition (or expression) used to match an element in the array.
|===

=== Example

This example returns an array that omits elements that are less than or equal to `2`.
The last two elements (`2` and `1`) are included in the output array because the
function stops dropping elements when it reaches the `3`, which is greater than `2`.
