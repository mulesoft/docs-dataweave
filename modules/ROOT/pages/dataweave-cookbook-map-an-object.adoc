The following DataWeave examples use the `mapObject` function to iterate through the keys and values of objects.
//LINK TO DW 1.0 EXAMPLES:
include::partial$dataweave1-links.adoc[tag=dataweave1Examples]

== First Example

This example uses both the `map` and `mapObject` functions to iterate through the input and set all of the keys to upper case.

The example uses these DataWeave functions:

* `map` to go through the elements in the "books" array.
* `mapObject` to go through the keys and values in each of the objects of the array.
* `upper` to set each key to upper case.

== Second Example

This example uses the `mapObject` function to iterate through the keys and values of the object that results from using `groupBy` on the payload. If some objects of the input payload have the same values in the `FirstName`, `LastName` and `Age` keys, the DataWeave script transforms those objects into a single row in a CSV file. The remaining values in the `Team Name` and `Role` keys for those objects are concatenated with `:` in the single CSV row.

.Input JSON Payload:

include::partial$cookbook-dw/map-an-object-ex02/inputs/payload.json[]
----

In the previous input example, `Sr.No. 2` and `Sr.No. 3`, as well as `Sr.No. 5` and `Sr.No. 6`, refer to the same person, as they have the same first name, last name, and age. However, `Sr.No. 4` refers to a different person, as it has the same first and last name but a different age.

.DataWeave Script:
[source,dataweave,linenums]
----
include::partial$cookbook-dw/map-an-object-ex02/transform.dwl[]
----

The DataWeave script merges the repeated values of keys `FirstName`, `LastName` and `Age` of the objects with key-value `Sr.No. 2` and `Sr.No. 3`, as well as `Sr.No. 5` and `Sr.No. 6`. These values are separated with `,` in the single CSV row. The values of `Team Name` and `Role` for those objects are concatenated with `:` in the single CSV row.
