[[lookup1]]
== lookup&#40;flowName: String, payload: Any, timeoutMillis: Number = 2000&#41;

This function enables you to execute a flow within a Mule app and
retrieve the resulting payload.


It works in Mule apps that are running on Mule Runtime version 4.1.4 and
later.

Similar to the Flow Reference component (recommended), the `lookup` function
enables you to execute another flow within your app and to retrieve the
resulting payload. It takes the flow's name and an input payload as
parameters. For example, `lookup("anotherFlow", payload)` executes a flow
named `anotherFlow`.

The function executes the specified flow using the current attributes,
variables, and any error, but it only passes in the payload without any
attributes or variables. Similarly, the called flow will only return
its payload.

Note that `lookup` function does not support calling subflows.

[WARNING]
====
Always keep in mind that a functional language like DataWeave expects the
invocation of the `lookup` function to _not_ have side effects. So, the
internal workings of the DataWeave engine might cause a `lookup` function
to be invoked in parallel with other `lookup` functions, or not to be invoked
at all.

MuleSoft recommends that you invoke flows with the Flow Ref (`flow-ref`)
component, using the `target` attribute to put the result of the flow in a
`var` and then referencing that `var` from within the DataWeave script.

=== Parameters

[%header, cols="1,3"]
|===
| Name | Description
| `flowName` | A string that identifies the target flow.
| `payload` | The payload to send to the target flow, which can be any (`Any`) type.
| `timeoutMillis` | Optional. Timeout (in milliseconds) for the execution of the target flow. Defaults to `2000` milliseconds (2 seconds) if the thread that is executing is CPU_LIGHT or CPU_INTENSIVE, or 1 minute when executing from other threads. If the lookup takes more time than the specified `timeoutMillis` value, an error is raised.

=== Example

This example shows XML for two flows. The `lookup` function in `flow1` executes
`flow2` and passes the object `{test:'hello '}` as its payload to `flow2`. The
Set Payload component  (`<set-payload/>`) in `flow2` then concatenates the
value  of `{test:'hello '}` with the string `world` to output and log
`hello world`.
