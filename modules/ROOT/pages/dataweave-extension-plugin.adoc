== Developing DataWeave Libraries

A DataWeave library is a reusable package of DataWeave modules and mappings files, and resources files such as JSON, XML, and CSV. To develop DataWeave libraries, first create a new DataWeave project in Visual Studio Code where you then create, preview, and test custom mappings and modules.

If you want to try out your mapping without creating a DataWeave project, you can either open your `.dwl` mapping file directly in Visual Studio Code or create a new one and use <<sample-data,sample data>> and <<scenarios,scenarios>>.

=== Understanding the DataWeave Project Structure

DataWeave projects use Apache Maven to build and declare project dependencies. The following diagram shows the DataWeave project structure:

```
├── src
│   ├── main
│   │   ├── dw
│   │   │   ├── MyMapping.dwl  //Put your DataWeave mapping file here
|   |   |   └── MyModule.dwl   //Put your DataWeave module file here
│   │   └── resources
│   └── test
│       ├── dw
│       │   └── Test.dwl  //Unit tests
│       │   └── MyMapping
│       │       └── default
│       │           └── inputs
│       │               └── payload.json //[Sample data](#sample-data) for your mappings
│       ├── resources
├── pom.xml
```

=== Create a DataWeave Project

To create a new project:

. Open Visual Studio Code.
. Click *View > Command Palette*.
. In the search bar, type `dataweave`.
. Select *DataWeave: Create New Library Project*.
+
image::dataweave-extension-new-project.png[Command Palette with DataWeave: Create New Library Project option selected]
[start=5]
. Follow prompts to complete an initial configuration for your project:
+
.. *Organization ID* (Group ID)
.. *Artifact ID*
.. *Version*
.. *Project name*
[start=5]
. Choose a directory folder for your new project.
. Select *OK*.
. When prompted, select *Yes* or *No* whether you want to open the project in a new Visual Studio Code window.

The following image shows a new DataWeave project in Visual Studio Code:

image::dataweave-extension-new-project-sample.png[DataWeave project example window]

//image::animations/new_project.gif[New project creation steps]
//![](animations/new_project.gif)

When creating a DataWeave project, the DataWeave 2.0 extension requires all dependencies to be loaded and indexed before it can search the libraries and make them available in your project. Visual Studio Code provides a notification bar at the bottom of the screen editor that shows when the dependencies are loading and when the indexing is complete.

image::dataweave-extension-dependencies.png[Dependencies loading and indexing]
//image::animations/loading.gif[Dependencies loading and indexing]
// ![](animations/loading.gif)

== Create a DataWeave Module

DataWeave modules are `.dwl` files that define functions, variables, types, and namespaces. These files cannot contain output directives, body expressions, or `---` separators between header and body sections. A DataWeave module enables you to share all the content defined in the `.dwl` file for reuse.

To create a new DataWeave module:

. In Visual Studio Code, click *View > Command Palette*.
. In the search bar, type `dataweave`.
. Select *DataWeave: Create New Module*.
+

image::dataweave-extension-createmodule.png[Command Palette with DataWeave: Create new module option selected]
//image::animations/new_mapping.gif[Creating new Module using DataWeave Extension Plugin]
// ![](animations/new_mapping.gif)

== Test a DataWeave Module

There are two ways to test your module:

* By running a unit test
* By creating a test mapping located in your `src/test/dw` folder to avoid exposing the test to to consumers of your module

The tests use functions of the modules `dw::test::Tests` and `dw::test::Asserts` provided by the artifact `org.mule.weave.wtf` of the
//xref:dataweave-testingframework.adoc[DataWeave Testing Framework].

To generate a unit test for a DataWeave module, follow these steps:

. In Visual Studio Code, open your DataWeave project.
. Navigate to the `src/main/dw` folder.
. Select your module `.dwl` file.
. In your module `.dwl` file, click the *Add Unit Test* button located above your function.
+
image::dataweave-extension-testmodule-1.png[MyModule.dwl file showing the function and the Add Unit Test button]

//image::animations/moduleTest.gif[Test Module Steps]
// ![](animations/moduleTest.gif)

This behavior generates:

* A new `.dwl` test file for the module under the `src/test/dw` folder. The test file defines a test case for the function that you call with specific arguments and make assertions over the output.
* Either a new test suite for the function, consisting of your new test case, or a new test case to an existing test suite.
// > Dev team please define/explain better test file vs test case vs test suite

image::dataweave-extension-testmodule-2.png[MyModuleTest.dwl file in the src/test/dw folder]

To run the test:

. In Visual Studio Code, go to the *TESTING* tab.
. Select the dropdown arrows of your module test file.
. Click the *Run Test* arrow button.

image::dataweave-extension-testmodule-3.png[MyModuleTest file in the TESTING TAB and Run Test button]


== Create a DataWeave Mapping

A DataWeave mapping is a `.dwl` file that enables you to map and connect to anything, regardless of data type or structure. As when using a DataWeave module, you can use a mapping to define functions, variables, types, and namespaces, but you can additionally specify a body section after the separator `---`.

Unlike a DataWeave module file, a DataWeave mapping file is an executable unit that enables you to transform zero or more inputs into a single output. Using the DataWeave 2.0 extension, you can develop these files to create reusable assets that you can deploy and share with others.

To create a new DataWeave mapping, follow these steps:

. In Visual Studio Code, click *View > Command Palette*.
. In the search bar, type `dataweave`.
. Select *DataWeave: Create New Mapping*.

image::dataweave-extension-createmapping.png[Command Palette with DataWeave: Create new mapping selected]
//image::animations/new_mapping.gif[Creating new mapping using DataWeave Extension Plugin]
// ![](animations/new_mapping.gif)

[[sample-data]]
=== Define Sample Data for DataWeave Mappings

Generate multiple sample data inputs for your mapping by clicking the *Define Sample Data* button at the top of your mapping `.dwl` file. Sample data is a key part of DataWeave project development, because it is used to run your mappings and also for suggestions.

// Dev team clarify "sample data used for suggestions"

To define sample data, follow these steps:

. In Visual Studio Code, open your DataWeave project.
. Navigate to the `src/main/dw` folder.
. Select your mapping `.dwl` file.
. Click the *Define Sample Data* button located above your mapping `.dwl` file.
+
image::dataweave-extension-sampledata-1.png[MyMapping.dwl file with Define Sample Data button]
//image::animations/sample_data.gif[Define Sample Data steps]
// ![](animations/sample_data.gif)

Using sample data generates a DataWeave _scenario_ that contains all the resources required to run the mapping in the context of that scenario.

image::dataweave-extension-sampledata-2.png[Generated new sample data payload.json file as input for the MyMapping.dwl file]

[[scenarios]]
== Understanding DataWeave Scenarios

A DataWeave _scenario_ is a group of inputs and outputs that you can inject into your mapping either to try out in the *Preview Output* view or to evaluate your transformation and compare it with your desired output. Scenarios also provide autocompletion based on the input structures.

These scenarios and their resources live in the `src/test/resources` folder and have the following structure:

```
├── pom.xml
├── src
│   ├── main
│   │   ├── dw
│   │   │   ├── MyMapping.dwl //Put your DataWeave file here
│   │   └── resources
│   └── test
│       ├── dw
│       │   └── Test.dwl //Unit tests go here
│       │   └── MyMapping // Name of your mapping
│       │       └── default //Name of your scenario
│       │           └── inputs //Folder where all of your inputs live
│       │           │   └── payload.json //Input for your mapping (you can use it in your script, naming it to be the same as the name of the file without the file's extension)
│       │           │   └── vars //Folder that represents a name for your input variable in your script: in this case ,vars
│       │           │       └── test.json //Input for your mapping (you can use it in your script, calling it vars.test)
│       │           └── out.json // Expected output of your mapping running against your inputs (only present when testing)
```
=== Using the DataWeave Scenarios View

The *DATAWEAVE SCENARIOS* view shows the available scenarios for the `.dwl` file. In this view, you can add, remove, or set the active scenario that is used for your preview execution, or you can choose that the values be autocompleted.

image::dataweave-extension-dataweavescenario.png[DataWeave Scenarios view in Visual Studio Code]
//image::animations/scenarios.gif[Weave Scenarios view]
// ![](animations/scenarios.gif)


== Preview a DataWeave Mapping

After you define sample data, get feedback on how your mapping is working by previewing the output. To do so, follow one of these options:

* Click the *DataWeave: Run Preview* button (arrow icon) at the top right corner of your mapping `.dwl` file window.
+
image::dataweave-extension-preview-1.png[DataWeave: Run Preview button]

* Right-click the editor and select *DataWeave: Enable AutoPreview* to run it on every file change.
+
image::dataweave-extension-preview-2.png[DataWeave: Enable AutoPreview option]

//image::animations/preview.gif[Preview View]
// ![](animations/preview.gif)


== Run and Debug a DataWeave Mapping

Run and debug a DataWeave mapping to be guided through all of the mapping elements, which you can then fix or otherwise update. You can also set breakpoints to stop evaluating expressions and use all the debugging capabilities that Visual Studio Code provides. Debugging works on mapping tests as well.

To run and debug a DataWeave mapping, follow these steps:

. In Visual Studio Code, open your DataWeave project.
. Navigate to the `src/main/dw` folder.
. Select your mapping `.dwl` file.
. Click the *Run Mapping* button located at the top of your `.dwl` file.
+
image::dataweave-extension-runmapping.png[MyMapping.dwl and Run Mapping button]


//image::animations/debug.gif[Run and debug a mapping]
// ![](animations/debug.gif)

== Test a DataWeave Mapping

To test a DataWeave mapping, click the *Dataweave: Create Mapping Test* button located at the top of your `.dwl` file to create a new test scenario from a snapshot of your input and your current output.
You can also use this newly created scenario as a normal scenario for your preview or autocompletion.

To test a DataWeave mapping, follow these steps:

. In Visual Studio Code, open your DataWeave project.
. Navigate to the `src/main/dw` folder.
. Click the *DataWeave: Create Mapping Test* button (microscope icon) located at the top of your mapping `.dwl` file.
+
image::dataweave-extension-testmapping.png[MyMapping.dwl file and the DataWeave Create Mapping Test button]
[start=4]
. Specify a name for the mapping test.

//image::animations/mappingTest.gif[Test Mapping Steps]
// ![](animations/mappingTest.gif)


== Using the DataWeave Dependencies View

The *DATAWEAVE DEPENDENCIES* view shows all the dependencies resolved for a DataWeave project. The view enables you to navigate through all of your project's dependencies and open DataWeave files inside those dependencies.

image::dataweave-extension-dataweavedependencies.png[DataWeave Dependencies View]
//image::animations/weaveDependencie.gif[Weave Dependencies view]
// ![](animations/weaveDependencies.gif)


== Deploy DataWeave Libraries
